=== The scripts in this directory are... ===

    sdcard_write_read_confirm.sh

This performs the actions at the start of the preinstall wiki page, it assists in the first step of writing the image.
https://github.com/glennmckechnie/rorpi-raspberrypi/wiki/rorpi-raspberrypi-preinstall

It is a script I've used to automate the write process and reduce errors when the brain is foggy. It's overkill because sometimes I need to be slowed down and forced to think, and this script helps do that.

Running sdcard_write_read_confirm.sh will assist with the image transfer to the SDCard (providing you are on a Linux machine). 
Entering the command ' bash sdcard_write_read_confirm.sh ' will display usage notes.
Alternatively you can follow the manual instructions available where you got your Raspbian image.

    rorpi-preinstall.sh

This performs the actions of the preinstall wiki page.
https://github.com/glennmckechnie/rorpi-raspberrypi/wiki/rorpi-raspberrypi-preinstall

Running rorpi-preinstall.sh will give you an updated version of Raspian with the added bonus of a Weewx install.
You can edit this script and perform an automatic apt-get install, effectively answering yes to all questions, by changing apt_optn="" to apt_optn="-y" 
The script can be run by entering the command ' bash rorpi-preinstall.sh ' It also accepts the option 'noweewx' from the command line if you wish to skip that step.


    rorpi-readonly.sh

This script has been contributed by ssinfod.
It performs the actions described on the readonly wiki page.
https://github.com/glennmckechnie/rorpi-raspberrypi/wiki/rorpi-raspberrypi-readonly
It can be run to automatically download the compressed source file, unpack its contents accordingly and perform the necessary actions to turn the system into a read-only one.

Run as  ' bash rorpi-readonly.sh ' and it will quickly perform the read only root installation on the SDCard.


If you use the above scripts, read the wiki notes, https://github.com/glennmckechnie/rorpi-raspberrypi/wiki/Rorpi-Home , at least once as they describe what is happening, or happened!

=== Extras ===

    pi_voltagetest.py

This is a script to emulate the pulsing graphic, or lightning bolt that appears on the monitor and indicates a low voltage (thus possible file or SDCard corruption.) We are probably (I am) running headless so we can't see that power indicator; this script is offered as a solution. Credit and further info via the scripts headers.
It is offered as is, I've yet to test that it is as sensitive as the graphics.

Run as python pi_voltagetest.py and it will display a status message in red, in the top right corner of your terminal.
