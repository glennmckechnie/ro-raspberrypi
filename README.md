# ror-raspberrypi (rorpi)
A method to run a Raspberry Pi, using the Raspbian distribution, configured with a read-only / file system  - thus the name "Read Only Root Pi" or RORPi

It should then be able to run the Weewx weather station software ( http://weewx.com ) with the minimum of upkeep. It's not limited to weewx either, it should also be re-configurable for anything else that fits the same criteria.

Like any system that holds valuable information, it will require the addition of a suitable back-up routine.  That's not part of this HowTo and will need to be configured for your needs anyway.  Possible solutions may be offered for weewx, but later.
