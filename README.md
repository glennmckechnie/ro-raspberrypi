# ro-raspberrypi (ropi)
A method to run a Raspberry Pi, using the Raspbian distribution, configured with a read only / file system.
It should then be able to run the Weewx weather station software ( http://weewx.com ) with the minimum of upkeep. 
Like any system that holds valuable information, it will require the addition of a sensible back-up routine, that's not part of this HowTo - yet. Possible solutions may be offered later.
